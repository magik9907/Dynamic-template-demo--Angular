## Project concept 

This project demonstrates the use of `ngComponentOutlet` in Angular, showcasing its capabilities for ***dynamically rendering components***. By leveraging `ngComponentOutlet`, the application can load and display components at runtime, offering greater flexibility in modular design. The project includes examples where components are created and inserted dynamically specific configuration, illustrating how `ngComponentOutlet` can improve reusability and maintainability in Angular applications.


The declaration of the reusable component utilizes the ***dependency injection*** mechanism, which supplies the necessary information for the dynamic template system to render the entire view. This approach allows components to be dynamically injected and displayed, making the application more flexible and modular.
